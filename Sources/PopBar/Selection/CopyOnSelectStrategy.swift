/// Fast path for apps with **"copy on select"** — notably terminals like OTTY
/// that render their grid with Metal and expose neither the AX selected-text
/// attribute nor an honored synthetic ⌘C. With copy-on-select on, the app itself
/// writes the selection to the clipboard the instant the user finishes selecting,
/// so we can read it directly instead of synthesizing a ⌘C the app will ignore.
///
/// Why this can't pop on an *unrelated* copy (the safety the design hinges on):
///  1. it only runs after a real selection GESTURE fired (drag-select / double-
///     click) — a background or keyboard ⌘C never triggers PopBar at all;
///  2. the pasteboard `changeCount` must have advanced **during this one gesture**
///     (baseline sampled at mouse-down), so the write is bounded to this drag and
///     can never be stale clipboard content from minutes ago;
///  3. it reuses the issue #15 AX gate (`shouldAttemptCopy`): the focus must
///     plausibly be a text selection, so a non-text drag (a Finder icon, a window)
///     that merely coincides with a background clipboard write is rejected;
///  4. the clipboard string must be non-empty.
/// All four must hold; otherwise it returns nil and the resolver falls through to
/// the synthetic-⌘C `ClipboardCopyStrategy`. It runs after `AccessibilityStrategy`
/// (AX is precise and side-effect-free, so it wins when available) and before the
/// ⌘C fallback (this path is faster and avoids the unhandled-⌘C "funk" beep).
///
/// AX-opaque tradeoff (guard 3, intentional): a terminal that exposes *no* text
/// signal at all (non-text role, no range, no marker range) is rejected even when
/// the clipboard changed during the gesture. We keep the gate because dropping it
/// would let a non-text drag (a Finder icon, a window) that merely coincides with
/// a background clipboard write pop the wheel. The terminals this targets — OTTY —
/// report a text-bearing `AXTextArea` role, so they pass (verified in logs); a
/// genuinely-opaque terminal gets a per-app allow path — the terminal list below —
/// not a gate relaxed for everyone.
///
/// Programs that own the mouse inside a terminal (issue #8: herdr; likewise tmux
/// with mouse mode, vim, zellij) select and copy by themselves, so the terminal
/// has no selection of its own — Ghostty reports a 0-length range, which guard 3
/// reads as "caret, no selection", and a GPU-drawn terminal may not report a text
/// role at all. So in the apps on the user's terminal list
/// (`PopBarPreferences.terminalApps`) guard 3 is skipped: a clipboard write during
/// this one drag is taken as the selection. What is given up is guard 3's
/// protection there — a window or tab dragged in a listed terminal while some
/// other program happens to write the clipboard would open the popup. Limited to
/// that list on purpose: elsewhere a 0-length range really means nothing is
/// selected.
///
/// Unlike the ⌘C strategy this does **not** back up / restore the clipboard: the
/// selected text is there because the *user's* app put it there on purpose
/// (copy-on-select), so leaving it is the correct, expected behavior — we only read.
