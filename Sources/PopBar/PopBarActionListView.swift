/// The editable action list on the PopBar settings page — two levels deep, with
/// drag and drop as the only way to reorder.
///
/// Two levels, never three. A GROUP holds ordinary actions and is what the wheel
/// unfolds as its second ring; an action inside a group cannot hold anything
/// itself. The rule is enforced twice on purpose: the drop indicator refuses to
/// appear over an illegal target, so an impossible drop never *looks* possible,
/// and `ActionStore.move` refuses the same move again in case anything else ever
/// calls it.
///
/// ### Why drop targets are rows, not the gaps between them
/// A gap would have to be its own view, and inside a grouped `Form` every view is
/// laid out as its own padded row — a 4pt strip would visibly space the list out.
/// So each ROW is the drop target and the intent comes from where in the row the
/// pointer sits: near the top edge → insert above, near the bottom edge → insert
/// below, and the middle of a GROUP row → drop into that group. A plain row has no
/// middle zone, only a top half and a bottom half, so there is nowhere on it that
/// means nothing.
///
/// That needs each row's height, which `DropInfo` does not carry, so every row
/// publishes its own through a preference — never by writing state from inside a
/// `GeometryReader`, which happens during layout and which SwiftUI flags.
///
/// The whole `Section` lives here rather than just the rows, because the
/// preference reader and the delete alert have to attach to the section: hanging
/// them off the `ForEach` instead would wrap it in a single view and collapse
/// fifteen rows into one.
