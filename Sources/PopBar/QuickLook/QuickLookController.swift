/// The floating **preview window** PopBar's Quick Look action opens. Hosts the
/// system `QLPreviewView`, so whatever Finder can show with the spacebar — images,
/// video, audio, PDF, source code, Office documents, archives' summaries — shows
/// here, with zero per-format code on our side. A type Quick Look has no generator
/// for falls back to its own icon+name+size card, exactly as Finder does.
///
/// Deliberately NOT the system `QLPreviewPanel` (the actual spacebar panel): that
/// one is driven through the responder chain (`acceptsPreviewPanelControl`), which
/// an `LSUIElement` menu-bar app with borderless popup panels can't hand it
/// reliably. Owning the window ourselves also lets it remember its frame, matching
/// how `WebPreviewController` behaves.
///
/// A single window is reused (re-previewing navigates it rather than spawning
/// another), and it is owned by `PopBarWindowManager`.
///
/// The preview VIEW, however, is rebuilt for each item rather than reused. That is
/// what guarantees a playing video or audio track actually stops when you preview
/// something else or close the window: `QLPreviewView.close()` releases the item
/// and its player, and a closed view cannot be re-used.
///
